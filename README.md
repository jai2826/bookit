# üìö BookIt: Experience Booking Platform
BookIt is a modern, fast, and fully type-safe application designed for browsing, scheduling, and securely booking unique experiences (e.g., classes, tours, or workshops).

## üöÄ Key Features
Seamless Booking Flow: Multi-step client flow from slot selection to secure checkout.

Secure API Architecture: Decoupled data handling using Hono.js APIs integrated within Next.js.

Atomic Booking: Server-side transaction logic ensures capacity is checked and updated before a booking record is finalized.

Promo Code Validation: Secure API for validating discount codes (percentage/fixed) against database rules (active, expiration).

Intelligent Search: Server-side filtering of experiences based on URL query parameters (/experiences?q=term).

Type Safety: End-to-end reliability using TypeScript, Prisma, and Zod.
